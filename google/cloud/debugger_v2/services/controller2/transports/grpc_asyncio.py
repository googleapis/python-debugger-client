class Controller2GrpcAsyncIOTransport(Controller2Transport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for Controller2.

    The Controller service provides the API for orchestrating a
    collection of debugger agents to perform debugging tasks. These
    agents are each attached to a process of an application which may
    include one or more replicas.

    The debugger agents register with the Controller to identify the
    application being debugged, the Debuggee. All agents that register
    with the same data, represent the same Debuggee, and are assigned
    the same ``debuggee_id``.

    The debugger agents call the Controller to retrieve the list of
    active Breakpoints. Agents with the same ``debuggee_id`` get the
    same breakpoints list. An agent that can fulfill the breakpoint
    request updates the Controller with the breakpoint result. The
    controller selects the first result received and discards the rest
    of the results. Agents that poll again for active breakpoints will
    no longer have the completed breakpoint in the list and should
    remove that breakpoint from their attached process.

    The Controller service does not provide a way to retrieve the
    results of a completed breakpoint. This functionality is available
    using the Debugger service.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
