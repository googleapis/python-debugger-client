class Variable(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents a variable or an argument possibly of a compound object
    type. Note how the following variables are represented:

    1) A simple variable:

       int x = 5

       { name: "x", value: "5", type: "int" } // Captured variable

    2) A compound object:

       struct T { int m1; int m2; }; T x = { 3, 7 };

       { // Captured variable name: "x", type: "T", members { name:
       "m1", value: "3", type: "int" }, members { name: "m2", value:
       "7", type: "int" } }

    3) A pointer where the pointee was captured:

       T x = { 3, 7 }; T\* p = &x;

       { // Captured variable name: "p", type: "T*", value:
       "0x00500500", members { name: "m1", value: "3", type: "int" },
       members { name: "m2", value: "7", type: "int" } }

    4) A pointer where the pointee was not captured:

       T\* p = new T;

       { // Captured variable name: "p", type: "T*", value: "0x00400400"
       status { is_error: true, description { format: "unavailable" } }
       }

    The status should describe the reason for the missing value, such as
    ``<optimized out>``, ``<inaccessible>``,
    ``<pointers limit reached>``.

    Note that a null pointer should not have members.

    5) An unnamed value:

       int\* p = new int(7);

       { // Captured variable name: "p", value: "0x00500500", type:
       "int*", members { value: "7", type: "int" } }

    6) An unnamed pointer where the pointee was not captured:

       int\* p = new int(7); int*\* pp = &p;

       { // Captured variable name: "pp", value: "0x00500500", type:
       "int**", members { value: "0x00400400", type: "int*" status {
       is_error: true, description: { format: "unavailable" } } } } }

    To optimize computation, memory and network traffic, variables that
    repeat in the output multiple times can be stored once in a shared
    variable table and be referenced using the ``var_table_index``
    field. The variables stored in the shared table are nameless and are
    essentially a partition of the complete variable. To reconstruct the
    complete variable, merge the referencing variable with the
    referenced variable.

    When using the shared variable table, the following variables:

    ::

        T x = { 3, 7 };
        T* p = &x;
        T& r = x;

        { name: "x", var_table_index: 3, type: "T" }  // Captured variables
        { name: "p", value "0x00500500", type="T*", var_table_index: 3 }
        { name: "r", type="T&", var_table_index: 3 }

        {  // Shared variable table entry #3:
            members { name: "m1", value: "3", type: "int" },
            members { name: "m2", value: "7", type: "int" }
        }

    Note that the pointer address is stored with the referencing
    variable and not with the referenced variable. This allows the
    referenced variable to be shared between pointers and references.

    The type field is optional. The debugger agent may or may not
    support it.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Name of the variable, if any.
        value (str):
            Simple value of the variable.
        type_ (str):
            Variable type (e.g. ``MyClass``). If the variable is split
            with ``var_table_index``, ``type`` goes next to ``value``.
            The interpretation of a type is agent specific. It is
            recommended to include the dynamic type rather than a static
            type of an object.
        members (Sequence[google.cloud.debugger_v2.types.Variable]):
            Members contained or pointed to by the
            variable.
        var_table_index (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.Int32Value):
            Reference to a variable in the shared variable table. More
            than one variable can reference the same variable in the
            table. The ``var_table_index`` field is an index into
            ``variable_table`` in Breakpoint.
        status (google.cloud.debugger_v2.types.StatusMessage):
            Status associated with the variable. This field will usually
            stay unset. A status of a single variable only applies to
            that variable or expression. The rest of breakpoint data
            still remains valid. Variables might be reported in error
            state even when breakpoint is not in final state.

            The message may refer to variable name with ``refers_to``
            set to ``VARIABLE_NAME``. Alternatively ``refers_to`` will
            be set to ``VARIABLE_VALUE``. In either case variable value
            and members will be unset.

            Example of error message applied to name:
            ``Invalid expression syntax``.

            Example of information message applied to value:
            ``Not captured``.

            Examples of error message applied to value:

            -  ``Malformed string``,
            -  ``Field f not found in class C``
            -  ``Null pointer dereference``

            Breakpoint identifier, unique in the scope of
            the debuggee.
        action (google.cloud.debugger_v2.types.Breakpoint.Action):
            Action that the agent should perform when the
            code at the breakpoint location is hit.
        location (google.cloud.debugger_v2.types.SourceLocation):
            Breakpoint source location.
        condition (str):
            Condition that triggers the breakpoint.
            The condition is a compound boolean expression
            composed using expressions in a programming
            language at the source location.
        expressions (Sequence[str]):
            List of read-only expressions to evaluate at the breakpoint
            location. The expressions are composed using expressions in
            the programming language at the source location. If the
            breakpoint action is ``LOG``, the evaluated expressions are
            included in log statements.
        log_message_format (str):
            Only relevant when action is ``LOG``. Defines the message to
            log when the breakpoint hits. The message may include
            parameter placeholders ``$0``, ``$1``, etc. These
            placeholders are replaced with the evaluated value of the
            appropriate expression. Expressions not referenced in
            ``log_message_format`` are not logged.

            Example: ``Message received, id = $0, count = $1`` with
            ``expressions`` = ``[ message.id, message.count ]``.
        log_level (google.cloud.debugger_v2.types.Breakpoint.LogLevel):
            Indicates the severity of the log. Only relevant when action
            is ``LOG``.
        is_final_state (bool):
            When true, indicates that this is a final
            result and the breakpoint state will not change
            from here on.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Time this breakpoint was created by the
            server in seconds resolution.
        final_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Time this breakpoint was finalized as seen by
            the server in seconds resolution.
        user_email (str):
            E-mail address of the user that created this
            breakpoint
        status (google.cloud.debugger_v2.types.StatusMessage):
            Breakpoint status.

            The status includes an error flag and a human readable
            message. This field is usually unset. The message can be
            either informational or an error message. Regardless,
            clients should always display the text message back to the
            user.

            Error status indicates complete failure of the breakpoint.

            Example (non-final state): ``Still loading symbols...``

            Examples (final state):

            -  ``Invalid line number`` referring to location
            -  ``Field f not found in class C`` referring to condition
        stack_frames (Sequence[google.cloud.debugger_v2.types.StackFrame]):
            The stack at breakpoint time, where stack_frames[0]
            represents the most recently entered function.
        evaluated_expressions (Sequence[google.cloud.debugger_v2.types.Variable]):
            Values of evaluated expressions at breakpoint time. The
            evaluated expressions appear in exactly the same order they
            are listed in the ``expressions`` field. The ``name`` field
            holds the original expression text, the ``value`` or
            ``members`` field holds the result of the evaluated
            expression. If the expression cannot be evaluated, the
            ``status`` inside the ``Variable`` will indicate an error
            and contain the error text.
        variable_table (Sequence[google.cloud.debugger_v2.types.Variable]):
            The ``variable_table`` exists to aid with computation,
            memory and network traffic optimization. It enables storing
            a variable once and reference it from multiple variables,
            including variables stored in the ``variable_table`` itself.
            For example, the same ``this`` object, which may appear at
            many levels of the stack, can have all of its data stored
            once in this table. The stack frame variables then would
            hold only a reference to it.

            The variable ``var_table_index`` field is an index into this
            repeated field. The stored objects are nameless and get
            their name from the referencing variable. The effective
            variable is a merge of the referencing variable and the
            referenced variable.
        labels (Sequence[google.cloud.debugger_v2.types.Breakpoint.LabelsEntry]):
